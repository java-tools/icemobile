ICEmobile-Faces-1.2.0 Maven2 Support

If this is a source distribution, you will NEED to build the jars first so they are residing in the 
lib directories of their respective folders!!!

The following utilities are provided:

1) In /maven2 an ant script is provided with the poms for the jars to install to whatever local repository you have specified in build.properties file (edit build. properties and set the location of the local repository you would like to install to).
2) ant target "get-maven" will copy off the internet (make sure you have internet access)  the required jar to run maven from ant, to icemobile/lib
3) ant target "install" will install icefaces-push, icefaces and icefaces-mobi jar and poms to your local repository.

This really isn't necessary if you can use the releases repository at
http://anonsvn.icefaces.org/repo/maven2/releases/
Once the release has been made, it will take a day or so for the proper entries to be accessed.


NOTE: The instructions above assume that you have previously installed maven2.

Each example has it's own build pom and you can run >mvn clean package to create 2 different profiles
See which one in the pom is the default.  (either Tomcat6 or Glassfishv3 for now-->really just builds with 
jsf2 jars (tomcat) or without (glassfish).
You could also use the mvn command line (or your IDE) to install for example in command-line from this directory:-
> mvn install:install-file -Dfile=../lib/icefaces.jar -DpomFile=icefaces.pom

...or >mvn clean package -Ptomcat6 
(which runs the correct profile for a server which doesn't already contain the jsf jars).
